Like many developers, I started this awesome endeavor by writing static HTML in notepad somewhere around 1994. Since I'm still doing it in 2016, I'm goign to call myself a web developer. I might go as far as to say that I'm a seasoned one. Maybe even a *full stack* one, if you use terms like *full stack*. What I didn't do for most of my career is write about what I was doing in my career. That's where this site comes in.
